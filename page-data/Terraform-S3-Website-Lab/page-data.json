Sometimes people just need to see a tool in action and have visual steps to understand it. That is why I created this, so you can have the chance to follow just a few simple steps to create a Terraform module. </p>\n<p>Before you get started, this does get a little bit advanced, but I think you will be able to reverse engineer the steps taken to understand how everything works after the explainations. If not, you can always checkout <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/course/hashicorp-certified-terraform-associate/?couponCode=6A2C3DC1D7F20A87891E\">my course on Udemy</a> to get the basics of Terraform down pat.</p>\n<p>If you have any issues with code for the lab, you can <a href=\"https://github.com/jakeasarus/terraform/tree/master/s3-website\">find my code here</a>.  </p>\n<h2>Website Bucket</h2>\n<p>First things first, lets create our bucket.
