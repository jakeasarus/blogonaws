This was just under a month after I passsed my <strong>AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate</strong>. In this article I will outline the steps I took after passing my Solutions Architect in order to pass my SysOps Administrator. So as you read on, know that I assume that the <a href=\"https://blogonaws.com/Pass-AWS-Certified-Solutions-Architect-Associate/\">steps in the previous article</a> have been taken.</p>\n<p>I will just be writing about my experience and not really speculating on how to pass the SysOps Administrator exam if you sit for it before you Solutions Architect. </p>\n<h2>How to Study for Your SysOps Administrator Exam</h2>\n<p>Similar to how I studied for my Solutions Architect, for this exam I once again used <a href=\"https://acloud.guru/\">A Cloud Guru</a> as my primary form of studying. </p>\n<h3>1. Complete the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Course on A Cloud Guru</h3>\n<p>If you want more information on how to do this, go read the <a href=\"https://blogonaws.com/Pass-AWS-Certified-Solutions-Architect-Associate/\">previous article</a>. </p>\n<h3>2. Complete AWS Certified SysOps Administrator Associate Course on A Cloud Guru</h3>\n<p>For this one there are a few caveats. At the time of writing there are significant portions of the course that you can skip or just do a light review of before taking your exam. </p>\n<h4>Chapter 3 Deployment and Provisioning</h4>\n<p>Skip the below lessons.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Deploy an EC2 Instance Lab</li>\n<li>What is a Bastion Host</li>\n<li>Elastic Load Balancers</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This should save you about 35 mintutes of video.</p>\n<h4>Chapter 5 Storage and Data Management**</h4>\n<p>I skimmed through all of the lessons to see where I felt there were gaps. The lessons I ended up finding most valuable were:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>EC2 Volume Types</li>\n<li>Upgrading Ec2 Volume Types Lab</li>\n<li>Encryption &#x26; Downtime</li>\n<li>KMS &#x26; CloudHSM</li>\n<li>Sharing AMIs</li>\n<li>Storage Gateway</li>\n<li>Introducing Athena</li>\n<li>Athena Lab</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Skipping the other lessons in this chapter will get you past 8 un-necessary lessons and save you a little over an hour of video. </p>\n<h4>Chapter 7 Networking</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Skipped all lessons.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This will save you 2 hours and 48 minutes of video. </p>\n<h4>Chapter 8 Automation</h4>\n<p>I actually found this chapter lacking based on what I was tested on. My suggestion would be to add in some more study through <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/index.html#lang/en_us\">whitepapers</a> or just tinkering in the service yourself. </p>\n<p>That being said, I just did the lessons on A Cloud Guru and managed to pass, but 35 minutes was not sufficient in my opinion. </p>\n<h4>Total Time Savings - 4 hours and 15 minutes-ish</h4>\n<p>If you follow all of my above suggestions for lessons to skip or lessons to listen to for those particular sections it will save you over 4 hours of video watching. You should assume that all other chapters and lessons should be completed.</p>\n<h3>3. Take Practice Exams with the Exam Simulator</h3>\n<p>Once again for this exam, after you finish the above steps you will want to use the <a href=\"https://help.acloud.guru/hc/en-us/articles/115004506854-The-A-Cloud-Guru-Exam-Simulator-\">exam simulator</a> for A Cloud Guru which simulates the AWS exam asking similar style questions. I took the exam simulator several times. Each time I took it, I would go back and complete the lessons, labs, and summary again for any area I was weak in. </p>\n<p>For example - if I got questions wrong that pertained to CloudWatch, I would go through that section of the course again. You can even do this for the domains that the test covers.</p>\n<p>For this particular exam simulator I felt the questions on A Cloud Guru were actually harder on the exam simulator than they were on the real test. That being said I would still shoot for consistently getting an 85% or higher consistently before sitting for the exam.</p>\n<h3>4. Pay for the AWS Practice Exam</h3>\n<p>This time around I paid for the practice exam. Practice exams are 20 questions and you have 30 minutes to complete them. The experience of the practice exam is pretty much exactly like sitting for the real deal, except you are not in a testing center. </p>\n<p>On my practice exam I scored a 95% and on the actual exam I scored a 775 (minimum passing score is 720). So just be aware that the practice exam is far easier than the real deal overall, but if you hit the 90’s you will probably be fine.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In summary if you want to pass your AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate exam, you should:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Complete the course over at <a href=\"https://acloud.guru/\">A Cloud Guru</a></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Skip redundant lessons.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Take the <a href=\"https://help.acloud.guru/hc/en-us/articles/115004506854-The-A-Cloud-Guru-Exam-Simulator-\">exam simulator</a> over at A Cloud Guru.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Take it several times until you are consistently scoring 85% or higher.</li>\n<li>For any domain you struggle with go back and review lessons and do labs.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pay for the <a href=\"https://www.aws.training/certification?src=cert-prep\">practice exam</a>.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Expect it to be easier than the real exam and for your score to be high.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I hope you guys found this helpful.
